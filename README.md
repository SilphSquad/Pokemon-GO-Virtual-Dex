## Description
Pokemon Go Dex is an application that pulls form two different API's and can compare the arrays that they get. You can filter through a list of all Pokemon and grab information about them. The info you get is the name, type, generation, and the pokedex entry. With the filtered list you can then see which Pokemon are available in the mobile game Pokemon GO.

## Usage
This application can be used for a multiple of options:
1. [Search all Pokemon](all)
2. [Search individual Pokemon](#individual)
3. [Search Pokemon by Type](#type)
4. [Search Pokemon by generation](#generation)

## All
When you type 'all' into the input field you will render all the pokemon.

## Generation

## Comparing to Pokemon GO
The main idea behind this application is so that you can compare the list of Pokemon you just searched and see if it is available in Pokemon GO. To do this all you need to do is search for a Pokemon using any of the filters above and then pressing the Pokemon GO button. This will change the names of the Pokemon on screen from black to either green for available or red for unavailable.
